[HoWebsites](https://howebsites.com) is my personal website, to present my freelance web developer's services and achievements.

This is a full custom project, designed first to improve my Front-End skills.

The cursor and black design are inspired from the stunnning [Ultranoir](https://www.ultranoir.com/) agency.

Changing forms in bakcground, are built thanks to [Anime.js](https://animejs.com/).

The logo is my own creation.

It's build in Ruby 2.6.3 and Rails 6.0, whithout database, and deployed with [Capistrano](https://capistranorb.com/)
