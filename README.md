This is a full custom project, designed first to improve my Front-End skills.

The cursor and black design are inspired from the stunnning [Ultranoir](https://www.ultranoir.com/) agency.

It's build in Ruby 2.6.3 and Rails 6.0, whithout database, and deployed with [Capistrano](https://capistranorb.com/)
